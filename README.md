# Mongo-Scraper 

Mongo Scraper is a web app that lets users view, save, and leave comments on the latest news. By using Mongoose and Cheerio, we are able to scrape news from ArtNews.

## How to Use 

First, click the "Scrape Articles" button at the top of the page to see the most recent headlines from ArtNews. You can save the article by clicking the "Save" button, and you can also view the articles at the original source by clicking the link.

To review all saved articles, click the "Saved Articles" link located in the Nav bar. Here you should see your saved articles, and you are able to both "unsave" them or write a note about the article. Click the "Add/View Notes" button to write a note or see previous notes!
